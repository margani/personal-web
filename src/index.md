# Hi, I’m Hossein

## a software engineer based in London, UK

specializing in building (and occasionally designing) high-quality websites and applications.

I enjoy building things that live on the internet or a desktop PC. For the past fourteen years (since 2006), I have worked on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

* .NET Framework and .NET Core
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Node.js
* React, Angular and Vue
* Redux
* HTML and CSS (SCSS/LESS)
* Next.js

Also, as a DevOps engineer I have worked with the following technologies:

* Microsoft Azure
* IBM Cloud
* Vagrant
* F5 BIG-IP

If you’d like to get in touch, you can send an email to hossein@margani.dev. A current CV is available on request.
